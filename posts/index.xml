      <description>Hi community, today I will show you How I Hacked computrabajo.com.mx, a well known job market site in Latin America.
computrabajo.com.mx lets you post free jobs offers limited to the first 30 candidates, if the number of candidates interested in your offer exceeds then you have the option to pay for a full one to have access to the remaining candidates. Option to remove candidates subscribed to your offer is only &amp;ldquo;available&amp;rdquo; with a full job offer but I found a way to remove candidates from it in a free job offer allowing you to see the candidates that were hidden due to candidate limit exceeded.</description>

      <description>As we know sails.io.js is the Sails socket client that is bundled by default in new Sails apps. It is a lightweight wrapper that sits on top of the Socket.IO client whose purpose is to make sending and receiving messages from your Sails backend as simple as possible.
Currently sails.io.js has only support for Browser and Node.js. Here we will learn how to make .get(), .post(), .put(), .delete() and .request() methods from sails.</description>
